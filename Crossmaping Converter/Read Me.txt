This converts a crossmap from { 0x(FIRST_UPDATE), 0x(CURRENT_UPDAYE) } to { 0x(FIRST_UPDDATE), 0x(CURRENT_ENTRYPOINT) }
Place your crossmapping in C:\Foxy\
Your RageHashMap.hpp will be in C:\Foxy\Dumps\

Notes:
- This will only work with the correct formatting which is the BigBaseV1 style formatting (without the last line and first few lines, you should only put the contents of m_Crossmap)
- This was last updated on 3/5/2022 and it may break at any point in time.
- No support will be provided on this tool or any future versions of this tool.
